A simple CLI interface written in C++ compatible with Linux and Windows 10+ offering dynamic controls over interactivity and response!
# Building
CMake: Specify your project configuration in the root's `CMakeLists.txt`<br>
<br>
Setting project's name and output:
```cmake
...
# Set this to your project name.
set(_BuildProject "ExampleProgram")
# Optional: change this if you want to specify the name of the outputting executable.
set(_OutExecutable ${_BuildProject})
...
```
Add your source files:
```cmake
...
# Specify your project's source file here.
set(_ProjectBuildPaths "${_BuildProject}/main.cpp"
                       "${_BuildProject}/Foo.cpp"
                       "${_BuildProject}/Bar.cpp"
    )
...
```
Then, link your header files directory:
```cmake
...
target_include_directories(BuildingTarget PUBLIC "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/ExampleProject")
...
```
# Usage

It is recommended that you implement your own derived MenuManager class as it allows full control over language configuration as well as action handling.\
<br>
An example has been provided in the `VendingMachine` folder.

## Initialize a MenuManager instance:
```c++
...
// Here, for control over memory management, it is recommended to use pointer for all instances of MenuManager objects.
std::shared_ptr<MenuManager> menuHandler = std::make_shared<MenuManager>();
...
```
<br>
The building blocks of every MenuManager object are Page(s). Page provide a list of Selectable (that is, we can move the user current selection to that item), support for Unselectable items will be added shortly.
<br>
<br>
Each Selectable will also contain a SelectableAction, which is a wrapper class holding the action module. An action module is simply a function pointer that accepts a MenuManager object pointer that currently holding this Selectable, and return void.

## Initialize a Page instance and render:
By default, a Page is rendered through the `loadPage()` method pipeline. Though currently simple, i'm intended to extend the use of this pipeline, allowing more control over how a Page is rendered.
<br>
<br>
Page object are associated inside a Menu in the form of a `std::shared_pointer`. To create a page and populate it with items:
```c++
...
// By default, this will be printed as the first line of the page. This can be changed by overriding the render() method inside a MenuManager class.
std::string pageLabel = "Example page";
std::vector<Selectable> items;

// push some Selectable items into the list
// Selectable's constructor accept the first parameter as the displaying label of the selectable, the second parameter as an address of an action module function.
// Selectable will be covered shortly after.
items.push_back(Selectable("Item1", &MenuManager::doNothing));
items.push_back(Selectable("Item2", &MenuManager::doNothing));
items.push_back(Selectable("Item3", &MenuManager::doNothing));

// Finally, initialize the page with the corresponding components.
// Page's constructor accept the first parameter as the label of the Page. the second parameter as the list of Selectables.
std::shared_ptr<Page> pPtr(std::make_shared<Page>(pageLabel, items));

// To signal a loadPage() render pipeline, we first tell the MenuManager instance to render the next frame by setting the direct target. 
//By default, MenuManager doesn't render frames every clock run to save resources and maintain control over user interface.
menuManager->setDirectTarget(pPtr);
// then, we initiate the loading sequence.
this->loadPage();
```
<br>
This is the basic steps of constructing a MenuManager objects as well as displaying your first Page.
<br>
<br>
By extending the action module of each item in a Page, we can direct the user to another page with the same procedure:

## The Selectable Object
> To be deprecated.

A Selectable is an item on a Page that user can select and interact with. By default, after interacting with every Selectable, the current Page will be re-rendered. Though this behavior can be changed by signaling the renderer that this selectable is a redirect component to another Page. This will be covered shortly.\
<br>
Selectable exists as pure object on a Page so dynamically managing it is not necessary, though this will be changed in the future.
<br>
```c++
...
void action1(MenuManager* menuManager) {
    menuManager()->IOHandler()->print("Enter a number: ");
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;

    // GeneralUtils.h, concatenateString method will be improved, allowing automatic stringify in the future.
    menuManager()->IOHandler()->print( concatenateString({ "You entered: ", std::to_string(n) }) );
    // stop the interface from exiting this action module immediately
    menuManager()->IOHandler()->print(Enter a key to continue...);
    menuManager->IOHandler()->getChar();
}
...
// Selectable( std::string, (void (*)(MenuManager*)) )
std::string label = "Example";
void (*actionModule)(MenuManager*) = &action1;
Selectable item1 = Selectable(label, actionModule);
```
<br>
An action module is a function pointer that accepts a MenuManager pointer as it's only parameter and return void.
